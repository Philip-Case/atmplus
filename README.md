ATM App Refactored


What is the atmplus app?
MITxPro full-stack developer certification bootcamp, this coding exercise I  was asked to demonstrate my REACT coding skills by creating an ATM Machine app. My app has the selection options to withdraw cash ($US dollard) or make a cash deposit ($US Dollars), and the UX screen rerenders the account balance after each deposit or withdrawl. I used REACT, Javascript, CSS and HTML.

How I Refactored the APP?


What I Would Do Differently Next Time
This was an exciting exercise for m, paving the way for many improvement ideas to add.  Here are my top 5 roadmap improvements:

1.  Format the account balance display to REACT currency format: using import CurrencyFormat from 'react-currency-format';
2.  Adjust spacing and layout
3.  Add a print/text/email account transaction history to ATM Menu options
4.  Add transfer funds between accounts
5.  Add a welcome screen with account holder name
